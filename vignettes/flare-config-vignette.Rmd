    - **save_names**: the name of the variable in the FLARE forecast output.  This may differ from `csv_name` when you want to add more information to the variable name.  For example the csv may have `temp` but you want to save it as `outflow_temp` so you know it is from the outflow.  If the output file is `output.nc` then the `save` name needs to the aggregation function (`mean`, `min`, and `max` are supported).  For example, a value of `temp_mean` would calculate the daily mean from the subdaily output.nc file.  `nsave` in the glm3.nml file needs adjusted to output at sub-daily time steps (`nsave = 1` would output hourly if `dt = 3600`).
    - **file**: the name of the GLM output csv that has the variable.  This is defined in the GLM nml. Example are `lake.csv`, `outlet_00.csv`, and `output.nc`
    - **depth**: Depth for daily diagnostic.  Use NA for variables that are not associated with a depth (like co2 flux).

    the observation. In most cases this is 1. However, in the case of
    phytoplankton, the model predicts mmol/m3 biomass but the
    observations are ug/L chla. Therefore the multiplier is the biomass
    to chla conversion

    -   `NA` is required if no matching observations
    -   Name in this column must match an observation name

    initialize the state if there is an observation
-   **init_obs_mapping**: a multiplier on the observation when used to
    initialize. For example, if using a combined DOC measurement to
    initialize two DOC states, you need to provide the proportion of the
    observation that is assigned to each state.

    observation does not have a depth associated with it.
